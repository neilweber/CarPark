## What is CarPark ?
_CarPark_ is a small application that will allow you to keep the position of your car in memory just to find it easier and especially faster.

This app began as a fork of [Hugo Delaunay's](https://github.com/Skyost) Flutter app [CarPark](https://github.com/Skyost/CarPark).
That app has not seen any updates since November 2019.  As a learning exercise, I decided to copy the entire app, update, and then improve it.
Some of the initial changes include fixing lint warnings, replacing scoped_model with provider, code cleanup, and caching of TMDB responses and images.

## Features
* You avoid losing your car.
* You avoid fines.
* You avoid being late.
* Custom reminders.
* Lightweight.
* Free & open-source.

## How does it work ?
It's very simple : you arrive and park your car. Once done, open the application and select your arrival time, how long you want to stay, whether you want a reminder ... In short let the app guide you !
